NEED TO LEARN TYPESCRIPT AFTER YPU COMPLETE MERN STACK.

Introduction
.............

JS is a single threaded(one work at a time), 
synchronous(after line 1, line 2 will execute and so on), 
blocking(ex: before line 4, line 1, 2 and 3 should be executed. That means, if 1st line shows error, the other lines will not execute) language.
semicolon is not needed in js.

Javascript is loosely typed(dynamic) language. This means that, when we define a variable, we can later on change it to string boolean 
if it was initially a number.
eg:
let a=3
a=4
a="Anjali"
a=true
This will give the output as true, which is in the form of boolean. It is easy to change the value of variable in js unlike 'C', which is a tight 
typed language.


Javascript is a case-sensitive language. For eg, in 'console.log', error will be shown if the letter c is capital.

Operator in js
...............

+, -, *, / and % . These are the arithmetic operators.

+ Operator in js
.................

+ Operators in js are those which works for number and string.

 1+1 = 2
 "1" + "2" = "12"
 "ab" + "ab" = abab
 "Anjali"+ "Karna" = AnjaliKarna
 "Anjali" + " " + "Karna" = Anjali Karna

 If there is war between number and string, always string wins in the + operation. ex: "1" + 2 = "12" 

 Every time, the execution for + operator takes place only two at a time. So, whenever there are two or more numbers, the first two will be added 
 first and then the next and so on.

 ex:

 1+2+"3"+2+2
 For this, the operation will take place as follows:
3+"3"+2+2
"33" + 2+2
"332" +2
"3322"

So, the output will be "3322" which will always be in string and in doubles quotations as the string wins.


Variables
..........

Define Variable
................
For defining the variable, we use 'let'
Variables are never quoted in double quotes, and they should always be defined before being called. 

let name = "Anjali"
let age = 22
let isMarried = false 

Calling variable
console.log (name)
console.log (age)
console.log (isMarried)

Change Variable
...............

name = "Niki"
age = 23

console.log(name)
console.log(age)
console.log(isMarried)

// add, sub, multi, div 

let a=1
let b=2

let c=a+b
let d=a*b
let e=b/a
let f=b-a

console.log (c,d,e,f) [This is to be done when we need to calculate all the values in one console]

% (modulo/remainder/percentile operator)

It provides the remainder for a calculation.
 4%3 = 1
 14%5 = 4

Comparative operator
--------------------

===, !==, >, <, <=, >=


console.log (3===1)  false
console.log (1===1)  true

console.log (3!==1)  true
console.log (1!==1)  false

console.log (1>2)    false
console.log (2>1)    true
 
console.log (1>=1)  true

Logical Operator
----------------

&&, ||, !

&& -> for true, all should be true
|| -> for true, one should be true


//And Operator

console.log(true&&false&&true&&false) //false
console.log(false&&false&&false) //false
console.log(false&&false&&false&&true)  //false
console.log(true&&true&&true&&true) //true

//Or operator
console.log(true||false||true||false)  //true
console.log(false||false||false) //false
console.log(false||false||false||true) //true
console.log(true||true||true||true) //true


// Not operator (!)

console.log (!false) //true
console.log (!true) //false

Assignment Operator (=, +=, -=, *=)
------------------------------------

let a= 1
let b= 2
b+=a //b=b+a //use of "+="
console.log (b)


Rules to define variable
-------------------------

1. Name must be descriptive. That means, when we are assigning numbers, use num instead of a or b

let num1 = 3
let num2 = 4
let sum = num1+num2
console.log (sum)

2. Use camel case convention to define a variable
This means that, if there are two or more words to be defining a variable, it should be written as follows,

is he married = isHeMarried
full name = fullName

eg: let fullName = "Anjali Karna"

Number Conversion
------------------

Converting string number to number
-----------------------------------

console.log(Number("1"))  [Converts "1" to 1]

console.log(Number(false)) [Converts false to 0]

console.log(Number(true))  [Converts true to 1]

console.log(parseInt("3.45")) [Converts 3.45 to int value 3]
console.log(parseInt("3.92")) [Converts 3.45 to int value 3]

Converting number to string

console.log(String(1))
console.log(String(true))  [for string, the color will be white in vs code and for number and boolean it will be yellow.]

Boolean Conversion
------------------
All empty are falsie and all other are true.
For Number,
For number, 0 is false and all are true.

For String,
For string, no space is false and all are true.

eg: " " is true and "" is false 

If else 
---------


Functions
----------
function has two parts.
Function definition 
Function call

Function definition in js
let sum = function()
{
    Console.log ("sum")
}

function Calling in js
sum()

Passing values in Function
--------------------------
let sum = function (a,b,c,d)
{
    console.log(a)
    console.log(b)
    console.log(c)
    console.log(d)
}

sum (1, 2, 3, "fire") //passing the values in a, b, c, d

push pop unshift shift
--------------------------

all array method returns something but push, pop, unshift and shift 
method changes the original array.
