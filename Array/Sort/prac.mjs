// let ar1 = [8,1]

// console.log(ar1.sort())
//the output is [1,8]
//------------------------------------

let ar1=[9,10]
let ar2 = ar1.sort()
console.log(ar1)

//this output gives [10, 9] because it sees the first digit during sorting.
//so here, 1 is less than 9. and output is 10,9

//for [9,10,11], it gives [10,11,9]
